### Time Complexity

O(1) -> Constant time
O(log n) -> Logarithmic time
O(n) -> Linear time
O(n log n) -> Linearithmic time
O(n²) -> Quadratic time
O(2ⁿ) -> Exponential time
O(n!) -> Factorial time

### Space Complexity

Auxiliary space - extra space used in an algorithm excluding input

Time - Space tradeoff

Why do we ignore constants and lower-order terms in Big-O?
>We ignore constants and lower-order terms because they don’t affect how the algorithm scales as input grows large.
